# ME625_NURBS_SweptSurfaces
The objective of this project is to implement the Swept Surface algorithm in Chapter 10 in the NURBS book. Given a trajectory curve T(v) and section curve C(u), this project will create a B-Spline surface sweeping the section curve along the trajectory curve. Both T(v) and C(u) is represented by B-Spline curve initially.
